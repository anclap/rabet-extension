 This feature, which is in the settings section and is on by default, allows you to determine whether you will be asked to connect an app to your wallet or it will connect automatically.


 ##### 3. Auto-lock timer

This feature increases your wallet's security against the people next to you and who lives with you. If this is not the case, you should always lock the wallet manually, which most of the time users forget, and if someone comes behind your system and open the extension, they can easily steal your inventory. However, with this feature and by going to the settings and setting the automatic time for it, you will not worry about forgetting to lock your wallet.


##### 4. Transparent structure
![](https://i.imgur.com/pngEa7C.png)

The Rabet structure is designed so that when an app sends you a transaction request to sign, you see all the operations' details by signing that transaction. This will help you understand what operations the app is doing and what you are signing for. This process allows users to interact more securely and without any stress with any apps that uses Rabet.


##### 5. Secure
![](https://i.imgur.com/QbhUtsm.png)

Your information is at your disposal. In Rabet, your data is encrypted and stored locally on your browser. No one but you has access to it. Also, Rabet is an open-source application. You can download its source and add it to your browser manually by unpacking it.


 ### **How does Rabet help the Stellar ecosystem grow?**
When users interact with Stellar network apps in a secure environment and have a comfortable user experience, they are encouraged to work with Stellar network apps. This user interaction makes more developers willing to build applications on the Stellar network.


 ### Where exactly are we?
It's been four months since we started working on Rabet, and now we have released the beta version of the Chrome extension, but you can use it in browsers based on the Chromium engine, such as Brave - Vivaldi - Opera., etc.
We have a plan to release a version of Firefox in the future.
